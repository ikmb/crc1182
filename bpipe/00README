0) GENERAL

This code base includes some basic processing pipelines for the collaborative research center 1182.

Everthing in this repository comes with absolutely no warranty. 

If you like to report issues or request features/changes, please get in touch with the repo owner. 

1) INSTALLATION

Bpipe is a pipeline framework written in Java/Groovy. To run the pipelines contained within
this code base, you need to install Bpipe, available from:

download.bpipe.org

The pipelines in this code base where tested with bpipe release 0.9.9.2:
http://download.bpipe.org/download/show/13

In addition, you need to set a few enviornment variables. Use the script setup.sh to 
get help with that. 

2) PIPELINES

Pipelines are located in the pipelines subfolder. Each pipeline consists of three files:

my_pipeline.bpipe - the actual pipeline logic. This is the file you execute with Bpipe. 
my_pipeline.config - A config file you need to copy to your current directory and modify. 
my_pipeline.readme - Some additional information about how to use the pipeline

Pipelines will load pipeline modules from the $BPIPE_LIB environment vairable; this
should already be set if you followed the instructions above. 

Finally, to run a pipeline on a compute cluster, you will also need a config file for that. 
By default, Bpipe will use the file pipelines/bpipe.config - but you can copy this file to 
your current directory and modify the resource requirements for each pipeline stage if needed. 

3) Example 

Let's assume we would like to assembly 20 bacterial genomes from PE reads (1 pair per genome). 
For that we can use the pipeline BacterialAssembly.bpipe:

a) Copy the BacterialAssembly.config file to your project directory and fill out the variables. 
b) If you are not running on RZ cluster, copy the bpipe.config file to your project directory and
adjust it to match your compute environment. 
c) Make sure all dependencies are loaded (Prokka requires a lot of things to be in $PATH). 
d) Do a test run:
bpipe test /path/to/BacterialAssembly.bpipe *.fastq.gz
e) If that looks ok, you can run the pipeline:
bpipe run -r -n 140 /path/to/BacterialAssembly.bpipe *.fastq.gz

5) Known issues

This code base has the same limitations as Bpipe. 

- Requires a supported ResourceManager to run in cluster mode (i.e. it does not work on the Kiel NEC cluster)
